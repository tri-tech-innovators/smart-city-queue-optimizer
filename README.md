## Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Install the required Python modules:

```bash
pip install streamlit mysql-connector-python pandas plotly streamlit-lottie pillow
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ MySQL Database Setup

1. Start MySQL server.
2. Create a database (e.g., `registration`).
3. Create the `vehicles` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE vehicles (
    customer_name VARCHAR(50),
    vehicle_number VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    vehicle_color VARCHAR(20),
    vehicle_type VARCHAR(20),
    slot_number INT,
    arrival_time DATETIME,
    departure_time DATETIME,
    services_taken TEXT,
    service_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    parking_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    payment_method VARCHAR(20)
);
```

4. Create the `reservations` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE reservations (
    customer_name VARCHAR(50),
    vehicle_number VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    vehicle_color VARCHAR(20),
    vehicle_type VARCHAR(20),
    slot_number INT,
    reservation_period INT,
    reservation_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Database Connection

In `vip.py`, update your MySQL credentials:

```python
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='root',
    password='YOUR_PASSWORD',
    database='registration'
)
```

Replace `YOUR_PASSWORD` with your actual MySQL password.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Update Image Paths

In `vip.py`, update paths for local GIFs used in accessibility services:

```python
gif_path1 = r"C:\path\to\valet_parking.gif"
gif_path2 = r"C:\path\to\ev_charging.gif"
gif_path3 = r"C:\path\to\annual_maintenance.gif"
gif_path4 = r"C:\path\to\car_washing.gif"
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application

Start Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run vip.py
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Admin Login

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `vip@03`

---

## üí° Highlights

- Queue-based optimized slot assignment with separate logic for entries and reservations.
- Support for additional vehicle services with individual billing.
- Integrated real-time dashboard showing all parked and reserved vehicles.
- Reservation slots visually distinguished to avoid double booking.
- Vehicle type distribution analytics.

---

## üìÑ Notes

- Tested on local MySQL setup ‚Äî ensure your MySQL server is running before starting the app.
- Image paths must be updated according to your local system before running.
- Password stored using SHA-256 hashing for demonstration; consider environment variables or secure vaults for production.
- The vehicle number acts as the primary key and unique identifier.
